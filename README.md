Hello! This is my pet project, which is basically just a simple image viewer made in QT. Main purposes of this project are to learn and get some experience in the field and to recreate my beloved old Picasa image viewer, which was one of simplest but greatest image viewers that I've seen. As I learn, the project will grow, so here what I think it would look like, given some time:
- Simple design - no bloating with features, just basic functions and interface, main and only window is your viewport
- Vim-like navigation - seamless experience of moving between folders and images without leaving viewport
- Quick caching and image preview(I'm not sure if QT is suitable for that task, but I'll learn this soon)

## to-do list:
- [ ] Mime types, since I've only added jpg while testing
- [ ] Cache navigation and dynamic cache size allocation
- [ ] Preview icons should be clickable and animated
- [x] Put bar and tree widgets to mainwindow
- [ ] Make some keymaps
- [ ] Add small helper widget with current keymaps, bind to "?"
